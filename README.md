# Morse-code-translator
Arduino project uses LCD board to transmit Morse code from a button onto the board.

Download Arduino:

Wire one side of the button to Arduino pin 2 and the other to the blue line. Wire the longer side of the LED to Arduino pin 4 and on the other connect a 220 ohm resistor between the shorter side of the LED and the blue line. 

Upload the C++ code under "main code" and run in Arduino.
